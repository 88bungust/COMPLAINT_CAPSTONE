# COMPLAINTS

## A Project by Kayla Rucker

For the better part of 20 years I have worked in the Customer Service Industry. I have handled my fair share of complaints whether on the phone, in a restaraunt or even in my own personal life. The project is based on some of the top complaints across the country in the year of 2018. I have included 3 charts that will show some of not only the top complaints from some of our larger business, but they will also include whether or not the issue was resolved in a timely manner.

## Steps to Running the Program
1. You will need to ensure that you are using the latest version of Python. In order to do this you can visit python.org to download the program that works the best for your machine. This project was created and ran using Python 3.12.
2. You will then need to clone a 'repo' from github. During these steps, I will abbreviate repository as 'repo'. 
3. Within your cloned 'repo', I would recommend setting up a virtual enviroment. I will abbreviate this as 'venv'. In order to set up your 'venv', you will need to navigate to the file path. You will then type cmd (which stands for command) in the file path to bring up a command terminal. You will then type into the terminal py -m venv env. This will create an enviroment for your 'repo' folder. You will then need to activate this folder. In order to activate this folder, you will type .env\Scripts\activate in your command terminal.
4. You will next need to make sure that you have all of the necessary packages to run this program. To do this you will need to install 'pip'. To do this you will need to run pip install -r requirements.txt.
5. The following libraries should populate: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. These are all of the libraries that are needed for this program.
6. You should be able to run the program from the command terminal by running 'Python Capstone.py in the IDE of your choosing. 
7. Once you are done with the program, be sure to deactivate the 'venv' by typing venv.run"deactivate" from your command terminal. 

In the end my findings using this program are credit reporting, credit repair services and or other personal services, have the most complaints. The month of April had the most amount of complaints.
