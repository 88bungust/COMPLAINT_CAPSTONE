# COMPLAINTS

## A Project by Kayla Rucker

For the better part of 20 years, I have worked in the Customer Service Industry. I have handled my fair share of complaints whether on the phone, in a restaurant or even in my own personal life. The project is based on some of the top complaints across the country in the year of 2018. I have included 3 charts that will show some of not only the top complaints from some of our larger businesses, but they will also include whether or not the issue was resolved in a timely manner.

## Steps to Running the Program
1. You will need to ensure that you are using the latest version of Python. In order to do this, you can visit python.org to download the program that works the best for your machine. The project was created and ran using Python 3.12.
2. You will then need to clone the repository from github. During these steps, I will abbreviate repository as 'repo'. 
3. Within your cloned 'repo', I would recommend setting up a virtual environment. I will abbreviate this as 'venv'. In order to set up your 'venv', you will need to navigate to the location/directory where you have cloned the 'repo'. At this location, you will bring up the command terminal. You will then type cmd (which stands for command) in the file path to bring up a command terminal. You will then type into the terminal py -m venv env. This will create an environment for your 'repo' folder. You will then need to activate this environment. In order to activate this environment, you will type .env\Scripts\activate in your command terminal.
4. Next you will need to make sure that you have all of the necessary packages to run this program.  To do this you will need to run pip install -r requirements.txt.
5. The following libraries are needed for the project to run: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
6. You should be able to run the program from the command terminal by running 'python Capstone.py' in the IDE of your choosing. 
7. Once you are done with the program, be sure to deactivate the 'venv' by typing "deactivate" from your command terminal. 

In the end, my findings using this program were that credit reporting, credit repair services and or other personal services, had the most complaints. The month of April had the most amount of complaints.
